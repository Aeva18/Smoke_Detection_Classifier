# Smoke_Detection_Classifier
Fires in buildings can be catastrophic, and early detection is critical. This project leveraged data from smoke detectors to identify the key variables that trigger alarms, ultimately enhancing fire prevention efforts. This project is a part of the requirements necessary to pass the Machine Learning course at BINUS University.
